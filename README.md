# Password Generator - John Zigterman

## Description

- I aimed to implement basic scheduling functionality in this project.
- I created javascript that added classes to the hour boxes to make clear which ones were past, present, and future.
- I implemented local storage to save previously entered information to the fields.
- Created a clock that displays current time and date at top of page.
- Built application using version control with appropriate comments.

## Installation

## Usage

The application can be used to schedule the user's day in a rudimentary manner.

## Credits
